## 🚀 Overview

**verif.ai** is a Chrome Extension that empowers users to navigate the web safely by detecting and flagging **AI-generated, violent, and clickbait content** in real time. Whether it's a synthetic image, deepfake, or a misleading headline, verif.ai acts as a digital watchdog—providing transparency, context, and clarity without fear-mongering.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration for **verif.ai** comes from watching our parents—and millions of others—struggle with online misinformation. In a world saturated with outrage-triggering headlines and eerily realistic AI-generated media, it's hard to know what's authentic. As digital natives, we wanted to create a tool that empowers users of all backgrounds to **browse ethically and safely**.

---

## 🛠️ What It Does

- Detects **AI-generated or augmented content**, including deepfakes and synthetic imagery.
- Flags **clickbait headlines** designed to manipulate or mislead.
- Identifies **violent or unsafe visual content** in real-time.
- Offers **transparent reasoning** behind each flag to build user trust.
- Runs **seamlessly and non-intrusively** in the browser, updating content detection as users scroll or navigate.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The extension monitors content on-screen and routes relevant image and text snippets to a backend classification pipeline:

- 🧠 **AI Models**: Google’s Gemini + OpenAI for multimodal understanding and NLP.
- 🔍 **Custom Filters**: Additional heuristics for detecting violence, clickbait, and synthetic patterns.
- 💬 **Flask Backend**: Receives data from the extension and returns real-time flagging results.
- 🧩 **Chrome Extension UI**: Clean, minimal interface with clear flagging indicators and reasoning tooltips.

---

## 🧗 Challenges We Faced

- Maintaining **fast inference speeds** for real-time browsing.
- Balancing **accuracy and sensitivity** to avoid false positives.
- Integrating **multiple AI models** into a cohesive, lightweight pipeline.
- Creating a **trustworthy, non-alarming UI** experience for users.

---

## 🌟 Accomplishments

- High-accuracy flagging of AI-generated and violent content.
- Seamless integration between frontend and AI-powered backend.
- Built a robust MVP within **24 hours** during the hackathon.
- Created an approachable solution to a **globally relevant** problem.

---

## 🧠 What We Learned

- **Prompt engineering and model tuning** are essential to building ethical AI tools.
- Users need **transparency** in automated decisions to trust what they’re seeing.
- There’s a huge **demand for AI that protects**, not just entertains.
- Cross-functional collaboration between design, ethics, and engineering is key.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- 🛍️ **Launch on Chrome Web Store** to gather public feedback and iterate quickly.
- 🌐 **Multilingual support** to tackle misinformation around the globe.
- 🎙️ **Audio and video content detection** for broader media analysis.
- 🧩 **Public API** to allow third-party platforms to integrate verif.ai into their safety pipelines.
